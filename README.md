# GeneralPy
A bunch of cool little functions packed into one file. Will update soon!
Import the file into your python code, have fun!


If you want to use a few things, like CallComplex and Debug, you need to snoop around in it, and replace the open("FILE HERE") with the name of the file you are running, or want to debug or call a function in.
Like i said in the files, CallComplex and Debug may not work.
